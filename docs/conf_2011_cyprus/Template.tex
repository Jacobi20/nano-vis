\section{INTRODUCTION}

\section{PAGE FORMAT}

A "US Letter" page size, 8.5 in (21.59 cm) by 11.0 in (27.94 cm), is used, with top, left, and right margins of 0.75in (1.905cm), and a bottom margin of 1.0 in (2.54 cm). The body of the paper is set in a two-column style, with each column measuring 3.33 in (8.46 cm) with a 0.33 in (0.84 cm) column gutter between the columns.

If your standard paper size is A4, please format your document to the above margin specifications, making certain the columns are no longer than 9.25 in (23.495 cm) and trim the pages to 8.5 by 11.0 inches.

Do not use page numbers on the paper - the papers will be collected as part of the conference proceedings and will be numbered at press time. If the author presents camera-ready hard copy of the paper rather than electronic one, then author's name and the ordering must be written on the reverse of each page (e.g. "Smith, page 1 of 8"). This will help ensure the proper pagination and printing of the paper.
